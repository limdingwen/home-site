				<h1>The Three Columns of Abstraction</h1>
				<p>You can script a game engine in assembly using a steady hand and a magnetic needle. You can write to the BIOS using Python and a hex editor. You can also write to the bare metal using assembly and a very sophisticated IDE. They are unrelated, and each of them form a column in the Three Columns of Abstraction.</p>
				<p>The columns are:</p>

				<h2>Pre-built code</h2>
				<p>At the low end, you have bare metal*. At the high end, you have game engines.<br>
				Consequences of going low: Harder, more tedious BUT faster, smaller, more flexible.<br>
				Consequences of going high: Slower, bulkier BUT easier, less tedious.</p>

				<h2>Language</h2>
				<p>At the low end, you have machine language. At the high end, you have scripting languages.<br>
				Consequences of going low: Harder, more tedious BUT faster, smaller, more flexible.<br>
				Consequences of going high: Slower, bulkier BUT easier, less tedious.</p>

				<h2>Tooling</h2>
				<p>At the low end, you have a steady hand and a magnetic needle. At the high end, you have sophisticated IDEs.<br>
				Consequences of going low: Harder, more tedious BUT more flexible.<br>
				Consequences of going high: Easier, less tedious.</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>The combination that I go with personally is:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Pre-built code: Go as low as you practically can, for faster and smaller code</li>
					<li>Language: Go as low as you practically can, for faster and smaller code</li>
					<li>Tooling: Go as high as you practically can, for easier programming with no impact on software performance &spades;</li>	
				</ul>

				<p>* You could go down even further to the logic of the circuits and such, but that's out of the field of software engineering.</p>
