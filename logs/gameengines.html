				<h1>Game Engines</h1>
				<p>This log doesn't apply to just game engines, it applies to abstraction in general, including integrated circuits, standard libraries, frameworks and such. Specifically, it applies to the pre-built column in my other log <a href="abstraction.html">The Three Columns of Abstraction</a>. I'll go into deeper detail on the pros and cons of each extreme, and the situations in which I would use a game engine instead of programming from scratch.</p>
			
				<h2>Pros and Cons of a Game Engine</h2>
				<p>Pros: Easier to use, easier to prototype in, lower barrier of entry, pre-built advanced 3-D technologies usable from the start, better results for beginners.<br>
				Cons: More restrictive, imposes a framework on you, unremovable overhead (bigger size, more memory and cycles required), may be vendor-locked.</p>

				<h2>Pros and Cons of programming your own</h2>
				<p>Pros: Much more flexible, customized framework and workflow, no overhead (smaller size, less memory and cycles required), no licensing, full control.<br>
				Cons: Harder to get comparable results initially, tedious to prototype in, higher barrier of entry, education in 3-D technologies required.</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>Personally, I would default to building my own.</p>
				<p>I would use an engine when...</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I'm prototyping and I just want something out quickly</li>
					<li>My boss tells me to</li>
					<li>I don't really care about a commercial product and just want to be over it as fast as possible</li>
					<li>I'm in a hackathon</li>
					<li>I'm an artist and I just want a game out without doing any actual programming</li>
					<li>I'm starving and I need money</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I would program my own when...</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I'm making a game with no deadlines</li>
					<li>I'm learning how games and graphic technologies work</li>
					<li>I'm making a unique game that is different technologically</li>
					<li>I'm making a game that I'm passionate about and want it as good as possible</li>
					<li>I'm making a game for a low-power device</li>
					<li>I'm pushing the limits of the existing game engines</li>
					<li>I want to have fun doing a career I love. &spades;</li>
				</ul>
