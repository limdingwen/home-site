				<h1>Passive vs Active Devices</h1>
				<p>The definition of passive and active devices, in electronic terms, is that an active component can output more energy than inputted, while a passive component cannot. That means that computers are active, while typewriters and lightbulbs are passive. Practically, and in this log, I define passive devices as things you can leave untouched for 20 years and can still be used, while with active, you cannot.</p>

				<h2>Pros and cons of a passive device</h2>
				<p>Pros: Doesn't need energy to function, can last a long time, generally reliable<br>
				Cons: Limited in functionality, limited in accuracy and precision (practically), slow and tedious to use</p>

				<h2>Pros and cons of an active device</h2>
				<p>Pros: Wide range of functionality, easier to make more accurate and precise measurements, faster and less tedious to use<br>
				Cons: Requires energy, requires recharging, generally less reliable</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>I use a bit of both. Paper and pen for quick notes and doodles, paper and a printer for manuals, paper books, video games, watches. Maybe someday a sundial just in case my watch runs out of battery. &spades;</p>
